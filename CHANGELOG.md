* New Lucky Dog! (Kevin from [@Weesterner](https://twitter.com/weesterner)!)
* Changed Description on the Lucky Dog embeds.
    - Added Twitter links to the description.
* Decreased the odds so they are actually 1 in 100
    - With me adding more Lucky Dogs, it has actually increased the chance for you to get one, so now it is actually a 1 in 100 chance to get a lucky dog!
* Removed message deletes for errors.
* Moved old v1 folder to a [new repository](https://github.com/doobdev/old-doob).
* Added some fun Among Us commands!
    - doob/notanimposter {user} -  gives an ascii of an among us crewmate floating through space with text saying "{user} was not an imposter"
    - doob/animposter {user} - gives the same ascii except it says "{user} was an imposter"
* XP Leaderboard is BACK! (fixed by [@X Daniel](https://github.com/x-daniel-17))

## v2.0.5

    - Made a way to disable level messages in your server, Do `doob/levelmessages no` if you want to disable them, `doob/levelmessages yes` to re-enable them.

* doob/profile now shows XP and Rank
* Disabled on_user_update logging events for now, as I don't know how to grab a guild id
